<p style = "font-family: Lucida Grande; border-color: white; font-size: 36px;color: white;" border= "5"> 
	My name is Matthew DeWitt and I am currently attending San Jose State as a Digital Media Art major. I transferred to San Jose State from San Joaquin Delta College and my work is influenced by the things I love. My work tends to be influenced by movies, anime, rap, video games, and TV shows. I really enjoy using multiple images and blending them all together into one composition. My aspirations for the art world would be for me to become known for visual special effects or to have my business I plan on starting succeed for me. The company is called No Ceiling Media and the link to its Instagram is just below.   </p>
